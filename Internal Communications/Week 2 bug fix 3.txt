🔧 Codex Instructions: Fix Profile Saving Bug (experienceLevel vs experience_level)
Task: Ensure that no part of the app ever sends experienceLevel directly to Supabase’s .insert() method.
________________


✅ 1. Check Every Call to saveProfile()
Anywhere in the app where saveProfile is called, confirm that it only passes this shape:
ts
CopyEdit
{
  name: string,
  email?: string,
  interests: string[],
  experienceLevel: 'none' | 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'
}


✅ That’s fine—experienceLevel is expected here.
________________


✅ 2. Inside saveProfile() (in /lib/profile.ts), make sure:
* experienceLevel is never passed directly to Supabase.

* It is remapped to experience_level.

Like so:
ts
CopyEdit
const dbProfile = {
  name: profile.name,
  email: profile.email ?? null,
  interests: profile.interests,
  experience_level: profile.experienceLevel, // ✅ snake_case here
};


const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .insert([dbProfile])
  .select('id')
  .single();


________________


✅ 3. Delete any stale builds or restart the dev server
After updates, make sure you restart:
bash
CopyEdit
npm run dev


Also clear browser cache or try a hard refresh in case the old JS bundle is still in memory.

✅ 4. Confirm Working
   * No mention of experienceLevel in any insert() call

   * saveProfile() logs show proper insert with no Supabase schema errors

   * Data shows up in the profiles table with the experience_level column filled
